Welcome to 2 Greys 2 Crowbars! One of the chaotic NRP deathmatch rust-like server!

There is no objective, but one I may want to give is to survive!
You are able to survive in many ways, such as:
    - Building a base
    - Teaming up with others
    - Defending yourself

There are supply intercepter telepads scattered across the map, they will passively collect crates from flying-by cargo ships!
There are 4 types of crates you can get from these.
1. Supply crates
The first, most common and regular supply crate. Has a chance to come with materials or ancient dangers.
One rare material you can obtain from this is duct tape!

2. Medical crates
Someone is bleeding in a hospital, and you just stole their only chance at surviving. Cruel!
Every medkit has a chance to spawn in this crate, and there are no ancient dangers!

3. Weaponry crates
Looks like you stole the nuke-ops weaponry order!
This crate has a chance to come with guns, shells, magazines and other things that can help you in combat!

4. Anomaly crates
The scientists must be asking why their xeno crate was replaced with an orange.
This crate is the rarest, and yet the worst type of crate. It can spawn angry spiders and angry xenomorphs!

If you die at any time, you are able to respawn by clicking the Bluespace Crystal on your action bar.

With all this information in mind, good luck, and welcome to 2 Greys 2 Crowbars!
